# Binary Contract clause classification task.

In this approach, we considered the task of contract review performed by the legal professional as a set of actions aimed at analyzing a contract clause by clause to answer a single question.

For example, suppose a client would be interested in knowing precisely and preemptively whether a non-contracting party is a beneficiary to some or all the clauses in the contract and therefore can enforce its rights against a contracting party.

To do this, the lawyer will have to analyze the contracts to produce the exact answer. For contracts that span dozens of pages, this is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Our approach aims to remedy this by finetuning several pre-trained language models not to identify and extract the answer
given a question and a context but given a single clause from a contract, to answer.
precisely whether this clause relates or not to a specific question. It is a system capable of identifying the clauses of a contract that are relevant to one specific question.
